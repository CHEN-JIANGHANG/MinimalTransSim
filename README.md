# Minimal Transportation Simulation

Simulation platform to model, simlulate and analyse dynamic transportation systems (such as dynamic ridesharing, taxi or float of driverless car) and their users.

## Intro

The purpose of the tool is to model dynamic transportation systems (systems that involve a matching process between cars and passengers, making the car unavalaible for other users).
The approach is minimalist: the network, the matching system and the different users are simplified as much as possible.
It is event-based.

Intended results are analysis of reliability and efficiency of the studied matching platform for different kind of users or different global parameters (prices, average speed, number of users etc).

## Implemeted parts

The core system is implemented. It needs a choice and an implementation of a matching platform to be launched.
One matching platform is implemented (inspired by Didi, Shanghai). It only needs a set of parameters to be implemented.

## How to use
